# Volto-light-theme Theming Concept

## Introduction

Volto Light Theme is a customizable theme built for the Volto frontend of the Plone CMS. It offers a streamlined, modern design with the flexibility to adjust components and styles to fit various branding needs. This module will help you understand the core concepts of theming in VLT and guide you on how to present these concepts during training.

## Core Theming Concepts

### 1. **Base Styling**

VLT is designed with simplicity and a minimalistic aesthetic.

### 2. **Customizable Variables**

VLT offers a set of Sass variables that allow developers to customize various design elements such as:

- Primary and secondary colors
- Font families and sizes
- Spacing and padding

These variables can be easily overridden in the themeâ€™s configuration to match the visual identity of different projects.

### 3. **Extending Components**

The theme provides the ability to extend or modify existing components without breaking the overall design. Custom components can be created by copying and modifying the default components provided in Volto. This flexibility is crucial for tailoring specific parts of the site.

### 4. **Overriding Default Styles**

Developers can override default styles by creating custom CSS or SCSS files. These files can be imported into the project to replace or extend the styles defined in Volto-light-theme.

## Conclusion

Understanding the theming concept of Volto-light-theme allows you to build visually appealing and customized Plone sites that align with your brand's identity. By knowing these concepts, you will be able to extend, modify, and maintain consistent and attractive UI designs in your project.
